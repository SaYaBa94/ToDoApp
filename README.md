	Firstly i couldn't find any couchbase bucket creation configurition settings so i leave it. So you need to configure appsettings.json username and password also you should write bucket name to MainController' constructor in getbucket.

	I used asp.net core angular template. I tried first time angular so i have some bugs. some of them after login add and delete application doesn't refresh the components when you refresh browser components will reload.

 	Swagger runs at  /swagger path which contains api methods.

I was really enjoyed and learnt new technologies while developing project.
Thanks for making me see my shortcomings
I hope I can join your company
Best regards
